## General Information
This project was made as a school project in [kood/JÃµhvi](https://kood.tech/) (20.7.2023)

The project required me to deploy a [previously](https://github.com/JesusKris/vagrant-microservice-architecture) created microservice architecture which included a gateway, a message queue system RabbitMQ & 2 other services with their own PostgreSQL instances, using docker compose. The infrastructure is provisioned using Vagrant and VirtualBox.
